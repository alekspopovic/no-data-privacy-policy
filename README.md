**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

The game is very old at this point and it was built as a learning project many years ago. I have not worked on the game or updated it in any way since January 2019. and I do not intend to continue developing it or updating it. For those reasons I do not anticipate this privacy policy will ever need to be updated. You are free to periodically revisit this page to confirm if the privacy policy has been changed.

This policy is effective as of 2023-11-30
